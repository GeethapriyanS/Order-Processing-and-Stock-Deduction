ORDER PROCESSING AND STOCK DEDUCTION

I create a console-based application to process customer orders and update stock levels. The 
system will allow users to place orders for products, automatically deduct stock quantities 
based on purchases, and generate order confirmations. It will also track customer details, order 
histories, and ensure that stock levels are accurately adjusted after each sale. Core Java will 
handle order input, stock deduction, and transaction processing, while MySQL will store 
customer orders, transaction logs, and updated inventory records. 

Java Requirements: 
• Use classes like Order, Customer, Product, and Inventory to represent key entities. 
• Apply object-oriented principles like inheritance (e.g., a base Product class extended 
by ElectronicsProduct and ClothingProduct), encapsulation, and abstraction to 
manage data effectively. 
• Define methods in an interface, such as OrderProcessable, for operations like 
placeOrder(), updateStockLevel(), and generateOrderReceipt(). 
• Use collections like ArrayList and HashMap for temporarily storing customer orders 
and updated inventory data. 
• Implement 
custom 
exceptions 
(e.g., 
OutOfStockException, 
InvalidOrderException) for error handling during order processing. 
• Use file handling to store order details, customer transaction history, and stock updates. 
• Implement multithreading to handle concurrent customer orders and inventory 
updates efficiently. 
• Use JDBC for persistent storage, implementing CRUD operations for managing orders, 
products, customers, and inventory in a MySQL database. 

DBMS Requirements: 
• Design tables for entities like Order, Customer, Product, and Inventory to track 
orders, products, and customer data. 
• Define primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints to maintain data integrity 
between orders, products, and customers. 
• Implement CRUD operations to manage customer orders and update stock after each 
sale. 
• Use JOIN queries to retrieve order details and link them to customer and product 
records. 
• Handle complex queries to fetch customer order history or check available stock 
before placing an order. 
• Use stored procedures to centralize the logic for processing orders and updating stock. 
• Implement triggers to automatically reduce stock levels once an order is placed. 
• Ensure ACID properties for crucial operations like order placement and inventory 
updates. 
• Create views like PendingOrders to track orders that require fulfillment and 
StockLevels to monitor inventory status. 
• Add indexes on frequently accessed columns (e.g., order_id, product_id, 
customer_id) to optimize performance.
